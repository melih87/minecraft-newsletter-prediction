    "## Phase 3: Data Cleaning and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we prepared our dataset for analysis by cleaning and combining the two raw data sources: `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by handling missing values in the `Age` column of the `players` dataset. Since we have not yet learned conditional replacement functions like `ifelse()` or `case_when()` in DSCI 100, we used filtering and `mutate()` to separate players with and without age data. We then calculated the median age of those with valid entries and assigned it to the missing entries. The two subsets were recombined using `bind_rows()` to form a complete version of the `players` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculated session durations using the `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` columns from the `sessions` dataset. These columns were recorded as numeric timestamps (in milliseconds), so we computed the session duration in minutes by subtracting the two values and dividing by 1000 Ã— 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then created a new summary table grouped by player (`hashedEmail`) that contained three new variables:\n",
    "- `num_sessions`: the number of recorded sessions per player\n",
    "- `total_play_time`: the total number of minutes played\n",
    "- `avg_session_length`: the average duration of a session for each player\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we merged this session summary with the cleaned `players` dataset using `left_join()`. Some players did not have any recorded session data, resulting in missing values for the session-based columns. To address this, we filtered those rows, replaced their missing values with 0 using `mutate()`, and recombined them with the complete-session rows using `bind_rows()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a single, clean dataset called `merged_data` that contains demographic and behavioral features for each player. This dataset is now ready for exploratory data analysis in the next phase.\n"
