    "\n",
    "In this phase, we prepared our dataset for analysis by cleaning and combining the two raw data sources: `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by handling missing values in the `Age` column of the `players` dataset. Since we have not yet learned conditional replacement functions like `ifelse()` or `case_when()` in DSCI 100, we used filtering and `mutate()` to separate players with and without age data. We then calculated the median age of those with valid entries and assigned it to the missing entries. The two subsets were recombined using `bind_rows()` to form a complete version of the `players` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculated session durations using the `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` columns from the `sessions` dataset. These columns were recorded as numeric timestamps (in milliseconds), so we computed the session duration in minutes by subtracting the two values and dividing by 1000 Ã— 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then created a new summary table grouped by player (`hashedEmail`) that contained three new variables:\n",
    "- `num_sessions`: the number of recorded sessions per player\n",
    "- `total_play_time`: the total number of minutes played\n",
    "- `avg_session_length`: the average duration of a session for each player\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we merged this session summary with the cleaned `players` dataset using `left_join()`. Some players did not have any recorded session data, resulting in missing values for the session-based columns. To address this, we filtered those rows, replaced their missing values with 0 using `mutate()`, and recombined them with the complete-session rows using `bind_rows()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a single, clean dataset called `merged_data` that contains demographic and behavioral features for each player. This dataset is now ready for exploratory data analysis in the next phase.\n"

    "In Phase 5, our objective was to develop a classification model that could predict whether a player would subscribe to the platform based on their gameplay data. To accomplish this, we used the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, implemented through the kknn engine in R. We began by splitting the merged dataset into training and test sets using an 80/20 split, stratified by the target variable (subscribe) to preserve class balance. We then created 5-fold cross-validation folds on the training set for model tuning. A preprocessing recipe was constructed to one-hot encode the categorical predictor (experience) and to center and scale the numeric predictors (played_hours, num_sessions, and avg_session_length). Using this recipe, we defined a workflow that combined the model specification with preprocessing and tuned the number of neighbors (k) using grid search across values from 1 to 25. The best-performing value was found to be k = 21, based on cross-validated accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finalizing the model with the optimal k, we trained it on the full training set and evaluated its performance on the held-out test set. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 72.5%. However, closer inspection of the confusion matrix revealed a major issue: the model predicted every test instance as a positive case (TRUE). This suggests that, despite the seemingly decent accuracy, the model suffered from poor class discriminationâ€”likely due to class imbalance or overfitting to the dominant class during training. While we successfully built and tuned a classification model, these findings indicate the need to address class imbalance and possibly consider alternative algorithms or modeling strategies in future phases.\n",
